###Locate a Specific Place From the List of Places Returned 
Click on any place name in the list to center the map on that place and open it's `infowindow`.

###Filter Based on Place-type
Click on any place-type value to remove that place-type from the list and subsequently remove markers associated with it.  A marker will be removed from the map once all its associated place-types have been unchecked.

###Get Additional Information About a Place
Click on any map marker to see its place name, local address, and get a link to a Wikipedia article related to that place (if an article is available).

###Start a New Search
Enter a new location, or type of place, in the search box and hit `enter` to start a new search.  (Searches are not additive.)
